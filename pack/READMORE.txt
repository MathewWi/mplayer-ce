---Compiling
In order to compile mplayer_ce you first need to build the necessary libs, stored in the libs
directory.

Please note that libdvdread and libdvdnav are now included in the main MPlayer release.  Make
may give you an error if you still have the libs in your libogc folder, delete them to avoid
the error.

Build libogc with 'make wii' and 'make install'
libfat with 'make wii-release' and then copying the libogc folder to your DevkitPro directory
libfreetype with 'make' and 'make install'
libjpeg with 'make' and 'make install'
libiconv with 'make' and 'make install-lib'

Now you can build mplayer_ce with 'make'.
It should create mplayer.dol in the mplayer-trunk directory.

---Editing the source
The files you will want to look at specific to the wii port are
/osdep/plat_gekko.h
/osdep/plat_gekko.c
/osdep/getch2-gekko.c
/osdep/gx_supp.c
/osdep/gx_supp.h
/libvo/vo_gekko.c
/libao/ao_gekko_.c
/libao/ao_gekko.c
mplayer.c
Several other files are also modified but not to a great extent.

---Editing the confs

-----input.conf
The Wii Remote and Gamecube controller controls are mapped as:

GAMECUBE CONTROLLER     WII REMOTE          KEY
        A               A                   a
        B               B                   b
        X               1                   x
        Z               HOME                z
        L               MINUS               l
        R               PLUS                r
        LEFT            LEFT                LEFT
        RIGHT           RIGHT               RIGHT
        UP              UP                  UP
        DOWN            DOWN                DOWN

The Y button on the Gamecube Controller and the 2 button on the Wii Remote
acts as a modifier key (like shift) to add further control options:
		
GAMECUBE CONTROLLER     WII REMOTE          KEY
    Y + A               2 + A               A
    Y + B               2 + B               B
    Y + X               2 + 1               X
    Y + Z               2 + HOME            Z
    Y + L               2 + MINUS           L
    Y + R               2 + PLUS            R
    Y + LEFT            2 + LEFT            KP4
    Y + RIGHT           2 + RIGHT           KP6
    Y + UP              2 + UP              KP8
    Y + DOWN            2 + DOWN            KP2
		
To map a control in input.conf should be fairly self-explanatory.  First write the
key you wish to map and then the mplayer option you want, listed here:
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/tech/slave.txt
So for example, to make the OSD come up when you press 1 you would add

    x osd

or to make 2+1 switch the ratio to 16:9 you would add

    X switch_ratio 1.7778

-----menu.conf
There is little existing documentation on editing menu.conf, but it is that not difficult
to figure out by looking at an example.  It is an xml-like file and it takes the normal mplayer
commands.  To use it to load a specific file or stream use loadfile, e.g. to load a SopCast stream
from my own network:

    <cmdlist name="browse" title="Browse" ptr="<>" >
        ...
        <e name="SopCast ..." ok="loadfile http://192.168.1.65:8902/"/>
    </cmdlist>

-----mplayer.conf
This file is a standard mplayer file in which you can place the options you want mplayer to run with.
A list of options can be found in the mplayer man page: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html
If for example you want to force the aspect to 16:9 on load you would add the line

    aspect=1.7778

-----smb.conf
Self-explanatory, fill in the details according to your smb configuration.
